My name is Michael Slugocki, and I am currently in the final stages of completing my doctoral thesis in the Vision and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at McMaster University.  

<!-- My main focus of interest lies in improving object detection algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural networks) by better understanding how humans efficiently encode shapes, with particular emphasis on how interactions between features may be beneficial in producing a more efficient and robust neural representation of form. By identifying critical features of importance, and how the distribution of these features across visual space change human perception of shape, similar encoding schemes can be applied to early stages in training computational models to better recognize objects in the real world.   -->

Apart from my immediate research program, I am very passionate about programming and data analytics. I very much enjoy trying to automate common tasks, and can often times be found tinkering around with microcontrollers, and other electronic gadgetry at my disposable. I am also an avid chess player, and always love the opportunity to get a quick game in.
