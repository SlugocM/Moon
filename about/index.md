My name is Michael Slugocki, and I love everything software, vision science, and bayesian.

I hold a Ph.D. in Vision Science from the Vision and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at McMaster University.  My dissertation focused on understanding how humans efficiently encode shapes through neural coding schemes. By identifying critical features of importance, and how the distribution of these features across visual space change human perception of shape, similar encoding schemes can be applied to machine learning systems to better recognize objects in the real world. 

Apart from theoretical contributions, my passion and industry experience involves engineering software (e.g., applications, libraries, frameworks, etc.) to improve health and user applications related to vision.  Machine learning, computer graphics, and other fundamental tools relating back to vision science are always elements that I try to integrate into projects.  Above all else, emphasis on quality control and testing is at the core of my philosophical outlook on work.  Deliverables must function as intended at all costs.
