GitHub link: <http://www.github.com/slugocm/bayesfit/>

PsychArXiv link: <https://psyarxiv.com/fnp28/>

Published module on Python Index and GitHub called BayesFit that allows users to fit models to psychophysical data using Bayesian inference.  This module leverages the PyStan interface, which makes use of Stan, a powerful No-U-Turn sampler.

Responsible for solely designing and setting up a 4-way stereoscopic apparatus used to study stereoscopic vision in human observers.  I am also responsible for writing the calibration scripts required for proper use of such as device.  I will make these scripts publicly available on my Github in the coming weeks.
