# Website for Michael Slugocki 
  
Thank you for visiting my GitHub directory for this website.  I am guessing you might be interested in using the same theme that appears on my website.  If you are curious, I use: **[Moon](https://taylantatli.github.io/Moon)**, which is a minimal, one column jekyll theme.
