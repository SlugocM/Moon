My main focus of interest lies in improving object detection algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural networks) by better understanding how humans efficiently encode shapes, with particular emphasis on how interactions between features may be beneficial in producing a more efficient and robust neural representation of form. By identifying critical features of importance, and how the distribution of these features across visual space change human perception of shape, similar encoding schemes can be applied to early stages in training computational models to better recognize objects in the real world.
