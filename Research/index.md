My dissertation focused on understanding how humans efficiently encode shapes, with particular emphasis on how interactions between features may be beneficial in producing a more efficient and robust neural representation of form.  The engineering application of such theoretics are to improve object detection algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural networks) by reflecting on what operations are viewed as critical in coding for shape by such advanced biological systems.
